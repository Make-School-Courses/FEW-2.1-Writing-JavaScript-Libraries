- Published to GitHub
- Published to npm

Your GitHub and npm pages should show the version and size badges to let people know more about the project at a glance. 

- npm bundle size badge appears on both GitHub and npm
- npm version badge appears on both GitHub and npm

Your ReadMe should be well written. 

- Includes well-written description
- Includes code samples and documentation

You must code review with another student and apply their feedback to your work. 

- You have reviewed your String lib code with another student

Move all functions to `String.prototype`

### Deliverable

- GitHub project is linked in the progress tracker
- npm page is linked in the ReadMe of the GitHub repo
