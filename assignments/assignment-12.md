# FEW 2.1 - Final Assessment

## Description 

You will show your knowledge of what was covered in class. The goal is to build a library of JS code. Your library doesn't have to be extensive. It should try and solve a code problem. Here are a few ideas: 

- Build another API library - Use the weather lib as a model but use a different API. 
- Build a React Component - Think of an idea for a component that you might find useful for any project. 
- Build a library that manages a deck of cards. It should store an array of 52 cards and have methods to shuffle the cards and draw a random card. 
- Build a library that improves some standard async JS operation with a Promise. Think about the geolocation problem.
