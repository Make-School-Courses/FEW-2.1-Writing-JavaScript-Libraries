# FEW 2.1 - Assignment 6 - Bundling 

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to bundle your libraries so they are usable in the browser, Node, and React. 

### Why this assignment?

This is how professional level code is published. Its also the process that makes your code available across different JS environments.

## Project requirements

So far you have published two libraries: Strings, and Dates. Your goal with this assignment is to do the following to **each** library. 

Follow the guide in the lesson [here](../lessons/lesson-09.md) 

- Bundle as umd and esm
- Publish to npm 
- Test your work 
  - With a browser project 
  - Node project 
  - React project

Use Coverage to find areas where your code hasn't been tested. Test these areas by writing new tests, modifying existing tests, and adding new assertions.

### Deliverable

A link to a test repo with your test code using your updated npm package. 

Code reviewed by another student. 

### Due date

Class 9

|:-------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Completion   | <100% of functions written | All functions written | Includes all stretch functions   |
| Quality      | code is sloppy and throws errors or shows linting errors |Well written few to no errors | Includes comments, and variable, parameter, and function names are self documenting  |
| Comprehension| Can't explain the code written | Can explain the code | Could write the code again from scratch |
| Tests        | <100% test coverage | 100% Test coverage | - |
| Best Practices | Does not use CI | Uses CI | - |
| Work ethic   | few massive commits | Commits outline progress | Clearly show progression of the work |
