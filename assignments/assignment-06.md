## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to bundle your libraries so they are usable in the browser, Node, and React.

This is how professional level code is published. Its also what you need to do to make your code available across different JS environments. Bundling is a standard process expect to see it on a job.  

## Project requirements

So far you have published two libraries: Strings, and Math. Your goal with this assignment is to do the following to **each** library.
