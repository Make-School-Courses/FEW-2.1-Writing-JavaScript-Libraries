# FEW 2.1 - Assignment 7 - Date Lib

## Description 

Dates are super important. You'll use them often. The goal of this assignment is to create a library that handles date operations. 

## Why Do this assignment? 

You'll make use the JS Date Object often. Building a library around dates will give you a better understanding of it works and what you can do with it. 

## Project requirements

Your job is to make a class that _wraps the Date object_. Your class should have a Date it keeps internally. It should be able to instantiate itself with the same parameters that are used with the Date Object. 

**Challenge 1** 

The Date Object can be instantiated with a date string, or with a list of parameter for: year, month, date, hours, mins, secs. 

```JS
class D {
	constructor(...args) {
		this.date = new Date(...args)
	}
}
```

Read about `...args`: https://javascript.info/rest-parameters-spread-operator

tl;dr args is an array with all of the parameters passed to a function. The `...` (spread operator) deconstructs the array. This allows for a variable number of arguments to be passed.

You should be able to instantiate this class like this now: 

```JS 
const d = new D('9/26/1965') // Create a date from a string
const e = new D(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
```

Notice this works with any number of arguments. 

**Challenge 2**

Your class should provide human readable values for year, month, date, hour, mins, secs.

```JS
// Gets the current date with no params
const d = new D() 
console.log(d.year())  // 2019 fullYear
console.log(d.month()) // July 6
console.log(d.day())   // 27
console.log(d.hours()) // 18
console.log(d.mins())  // 6
console.log(d.secs())  // 5
```

**Challenge 3**

You need a format method that takes a "mask" string. The mask will contain formatting characters which displays various date elements, other characters are displayed unchanged. 

List of formatting characters: 

- 'Y' -> 2019
- 'y' -> 19
- 'M' -> July
- 'm' -> Jul
- 'D' -> 01
- 'd' -> 1
- 'H' -> 05
- 'h' -> 5
- 'I' -> 08
- 'i' -> 8
- 'S' -> 04
- 's' -> 4

The `format()` method should provide an acceptable default formatted date with no parameters. 

For example: 

```JS 
// Make a date with values for Y, M, D etc.
const d = new D(2017, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5)
console.log(d.format())              // 2017 January 02
console.log(d.format('y/m/d'))       // 17/Jan/2
console.log(d.format('H:I:S'))       // 03:04:05
console.log(d.format('h:i:s'))       // 3:4:5
console.log(d.format('Y-M-D h:I:S')) // 2017-January-02 3:04:05 
```

**Challenge 4**

Make a `when()` this should return a human readble description of 'when' a date will occur. 

This method should compare the date owned by your class instance with the current date. 

```JS 
const d = new D(2019, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5)
console.log(d.when()) // 6 months ago
const d = new D(2019, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5)
console.log(d.when()) // 3 months from now
const d = new D(2024, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5)
console.log(d.when()) // 5 years from now
const d = new D(2019, 6, 30, 3, 4, 5)
console.log(d.when()) // 3 days from now
const d = new D()
console.log(d.when()) // today
```

**Stretch Challenge**

Look for edge cases in the `when()` method. When does it not work? 

- Decribe the edge case, the problem, and what casues it
- Solve the problem in code

**Stretch Challenge**

Make `when()` work for time hours minutes, seconds. 

- 1 hour from now
- 3 hours ago
- 23 mins from now
- 11 mins ago
- 23 seconds from now
- 52 seconds ago

**Stretch Challenge**

Take the challenge above one step further by including both date and time. This is an open ended challenge you can make it as detailed as you care to take it. Feel free to interprept the challenge and make your best judgement as to how it can be implemented.

Here is some sample output: 

- 2 days three hours from now
- 3 years 5 months 2 days from now
- 1 year 4 months 23 days ago
- 3 hours and 24 minutes from now
- etc.

**Challenge 5**

Document your date lib. Do this by writing JS Doc string comments describing each method. 

Output the documentation to your repo or write it to your readme.md file. 

Use: https://documentation.js.org

**Challenge 6**

Publish your date lib to npm. Include the following badges in your readme.md:

- npm version
- license
- size
- GitHub Issues

**Challenge 7**

Add continuous integration. Use Travis-ci and Coveralls. 

Add badges for: 

- Build
- Coverage

**Challenge 8**

Use Rollup to bundle your date lib. Include both umd and esm bundles. 

**Stretch Challenge**

Use `.toPrimitive()` to allow your Data object to return a String or Number depending on context.

### Deliverable

After completing the challenges above post a link to your npm package on npm. 

### Due date
