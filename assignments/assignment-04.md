# FEW 2.1 - Assignment 4 - Continuous Integration

## Description 

Your job is to incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) into your work flow. As you saw in the lesson CI is an industry best practice that provides a lot of good feedback. 

Stretch goal: If you're ahead and have already published your work and adding CI has been easily accomplished it's time to create version 2 of your Library! 

### Why this assignment?

Doing this assignment will introduce you to tools and systems used by professionals and giev you an opportunity to follow industry best practices. 

It will also give you feedback on the quality of the code you are pushing and do this as an automated system. 

Why do thes stretch goal? The stretch is trying mold your library into a tool that is truly useful to the developer community at large. 

## Project requirements

With this assignment you will be wrapping up String Lib project. Your String Lib should meet all of the requirements outlined in the first three assignments. 

Your project should also now include continuous integration by connecting it with Travis and Coveralls. 

Your README should be updated to show badges showing test coverage and build status. 

## Stretch goals

**Stretch Goal** - 

Version 2 of your library should add some new features. Your goal is to identify new string functions and utilities you can add to your library.

- Invent your own utility functions. 
- Research existing libraries on npm to identify useful functions you can implement. Research these: 
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/string
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/camelcase
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-random-string
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-parse
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/magic-string

**Stretch Goal** - 

Use CodeClimate to analyze and give your code a report card: https://codeclimate.com/dashboard 

Note! Code Climate is free for open source projects!

### Deliverable

Your GitHub Repo updated with new badges showing the status from Travis and Coveralls.

### Due date

Class 5 - Mon, April 13

## Assessing the assignment

| Expectations | Does not meet              | Meets                 | Exceeds                          |
|:-------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------|:---------------------------------|
| Completion | Not connected to Travis or Coveralls | Status badges from Travis and Coveralls | You've implemented Travis and Coveralls in another project, or added Code Climate to your continuous integration plan. |
| Quality | Code shows linter errors | Code shows no linter errors | Code clearly documented |
| Overall | Build failing or test coverage less than 100% | Build passing and coverage 100% | -   |
| Comprehension| Can't explain CI | Can explain CI | Confident you could implement CI in other projects |
| Work ethic | few massive commits | Commits outline progress | Clearly shows the progression of the work |
