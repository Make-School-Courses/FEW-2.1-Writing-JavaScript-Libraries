# FEW 2.1 - Assignment 8 - Typescript 

---

Move this to lesson 11

---

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to refactor one of your previous libraries into TypeScript and publish it to npm. 

### Why this assignment?

TypeScript is becoming more popular, and is extremely useful in large codebases. Knowing how to refactor, write, and publish TypeScript code will allow you to decide whether TypeScript is right for a project.

## Project requirements

So far you have published two libraries: Strings, and Maths. Your goal with this assignment is to pick one of them to refactor into TypeScript, then update your rollup bundle and npm package.

### Getting Started

To get started you'll need to install TypeScript. Follow the instructions in [lesson 8](../lessons/lesson-08.md).

You'll want lint your TypeScript code. It's industry best practice! To do this you will need to install TSLint. Follow the instructions here:

### Refactor your lib

Choose one of your libraries to refactor with TypeScript. The Math lib is probably the best choice. Do the following. 

- Refactor into TypeScript
- Transpile into JavaScript - you should have a .js file and a .d.ts file
- Bundle as umd and esm
- Publish to npm 
- Test your work 
  - With a browser project 
  - Node project 
  - React project

Use Coverage to find areas where your code hasn't been tested. Test these areas by writing new tests, modifying existing tests, and adding new assertions. 

### Deliverable

A link to a test repo with your test code using your updated npm package. 

Code reviewed by another student. 

### Due date

Class 9
