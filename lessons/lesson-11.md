# FEW 2.1 - FEW 2.1 - API Lib

The goal for this assignment is to make an Lib that works with an API. 

## Why you should know this or industry application (optional) (5 min)

APIs are a big part of the web/JS ecosystem. You've probably worked with APIs before, and should expect to work with APIs in the future. Wrapping your code in a library will take your coding skills up a level. 

## Learning Objectives (5 min)

1. Describe APIs
1. Use an API
1. Use fetch, Promise, and async/await
1. Categorize code: developer vs Library

## Test Platform

At the beginning you wouldn't use an API. Take a look at this repo: 

https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/weather-api

The code here is a simple app that loads weather data. 

### Pair up and examine the code

- What do you see
- Categorize the code in the project
- What here could be put into a lib?

## Making getWeather() work anywhere

To make the getWeather() function work with any code you need to extract the parts of the code that tie it elements that are unique to this app. 

### Callback

Use a callback to decouple getWeather().

Implement a callback. 

- What are the advantages of using a callback? 

## Promise 

getWeather() can return a Promise. 

Implement getWeather() with a Promise.

- What are the advantages of using Promise? 

### async await

async/await provides another option for writing your code. 

Implement getWeather() with async/await. 

- What are the advantages of using async/await?

## Wrap Up (5 min)

- Review
  - callbacks
  - Promise
  - async/await
  - After class 
    - Start the API Lib
