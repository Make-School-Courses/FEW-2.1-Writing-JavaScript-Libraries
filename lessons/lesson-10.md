## Why you should know this?

- Modules are an important part of development
- Modules are used by Node as a core function
- Modules are new to the browser expect them to be used a lot in the future

## Learning Objectives 

1. Define your own modules
1. Use Modules to develop an application
1. Describe modules and usage and mechanics

## What are modules? 

Modules provide system for organizing your code into logical groups or libraries. 

For a long time JS stored all code in the same global pool of code. The problem is variables defined in one file were accessible in any other file. Defining an identifier in one file meant you might overwrite it another script you were linking to. 

Modules provide a system that allows creates scope based on files. It also allows variables/bindings to be exported or imported from other modules. 

Take a look through this article for an overview of modules: https://javascript.info/modules-intro

Use the exercise below to explore modules and practice coding.
