# FEW 2.1 - Final

Your goal is to fix our server. Open the sample HTML in your browser. You should see a list of user data that includes some dates, names, and numbers. This data shows users with loans. 

The data shows the loan amount, the rate, and the date of the loan. 

The data also inlcudes a company name, username, first and last names. 

Your goal is to make all of the data display correctly and calculate some values from the given values. 

Use your libraries to solve these problems:

## Setup 

1) Import your library from npm

2) Link your library code to the final project

## Code problems 

1) The user name needs to be upper case

2) The first letter of first_name and last_name should be upper case. 

3) The company_name should be title case (). 

4) Make a "slug" name from the company_name. This should be kabobcase. 

5) Format loan as dollars.

6) Calculate tax. Use loan as the amount and rate as the tax rate.

7) Format the dates as: "2011 Jan 11 (Tuesday)"

8) Also, include a relative date description. Something like: "3 years ago", or "two months from now".

9) Calculate the interest from the date and the tax. You'll need the total, years, and rate. Calculate the years as the difference between  today and date in the data.

## Extra Credit

1) Implement your API library. This is up to you. But illustrate it's use for the final.
