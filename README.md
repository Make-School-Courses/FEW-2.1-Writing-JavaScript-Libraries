## Class Assignments

### Projects

Over the course of the class, you will **write and publish 4 of your own JS libraries on the following topics:**

- Strings
- Math operations
- Date Objects
- API Wrappers

You will implement industry best practices by: 

- Writing unit tests
- Using a Preprocessor/bundler
- Publishing to Github
- Publishing to NPM 
- Using Continuous Integration 

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required assignments 
    - String, Math, Date, API Wrapper
    - Each of these should implement continuous integration, unit testing, and be bundled for distributions.
