## Learning Objectives

1. Describe, define, and use SEMVer
1. Create NPM Packages
1. Publish your NPM package
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why?

Get a deeper understanding of npm and it's ecosystem. Contribute to open source.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is npm?

<div>Node Package Manager</div>

<div>So what's a Package?</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
npm organizes code into *packages* (sometimes called *modules*).
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A package is a directory with one or more files**. 

And, a file named `package.json` which contains metadata about the package.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
A **_dependency_** is a package that your project (or another package) depends on.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
A package should contain code that **does one thing** well.

In this way, you can use these shared packages like **building blocks** to build large complex projects.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Packages can be written that work with **Node.js** on the server side, run on the **command line**, or can be used in a **web page**.

You can publish your packages and use them with all of your projects and share them with other developers around the world.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How does NPM work?

<div>NPM is three things: a <strong>website</strong>, <strong>registry</strong>, and <strong>client</strong>.</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The Website

<div style="">https://www.npmjs.com</div> 

<div>is the web portal for all things npm.</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The registry

<div>is a database of all packages that have been shared via npm.</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The client

<div>is a command line tool used to publish and manage your npm packages.</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
All of the packages you publish can be published from source code hosted on GitHub.com. 

The published packages each get a page on npm.com with notes and documentation.

https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Publish packages to npm

Follow these instructions to create an account, install npm CLI, and publish a package to the npm registry.

You should publish your String Library to npm following the steps below. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Sign up

Create an account: https://www.npmjs.com/signup
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Install

You will need to install Node.js and npm. Follow the instructions here if you haven't already done this.

https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### npm init and package.json

When you run `npm init` in a directory, npm creates a new file called package.json. This is json file with information about your package.

The data describes:

- name
- version
- entry point
- dependencies
- and more...
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
package.json is also a manifest listing all of the dependencies a package may require. 

One package may depend on another which in turn has its own dependencies. (It's a little like those Russian dolls.)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Make your package

Using Terminal, navigate to the directory containing your String lib. Run the command:

`npm init`

This should create a new `package.json` in the current directory. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Answer all the questions to the best of your ability. You can edit these later. Everything you enter here is metadata that describes the package that will eventually be hosted on npm.com. This includes:

- name
- description
- version

(You can use the default values, shown in (...), by hitting the Enter key when it appears.)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Login into npm

We are using the npm CLI you need to log in in the command line.

You'll need to enter your:

- npm username
- npm password
- email address used with npm

`npm login`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Publishing your package

To publish your package use:

`npm publish --access=public`

The first time you publish, you will need to add `--access=public` to avoid an error. After that, future publications will default to public access.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
#### Resolving errors

All packages on npm are public and share the same _namespace_. The most common error will be a _name collision_. It might look like:

```
npm ERR! 403 Forbidden - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/test-error - You do not have permission to publish "test-error". Are you logged in as the correct user?
```

Here I tried to publish a package with the name `test-error`. This package already exists. Hint: **Search for a name on npm** before publishing.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Another option is to publish to a scope. This puts all of the packages under the scope of your username and you can use any name. 

To publish under a scope prefix your package name with `@` and your npm user name. For example: 

`@soggybag/really-cool-package`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Publishing in scope

To publish to a scope, you can either:

Change the name to `@username/package-name` manually in package.json

Run `npm init --scope=username` instead of `npm init`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### View your package npm

Visit https://www.npmjs.com

Log in and click the profile icon in the upper right. Choose "Packages" from the menu. This should show the list of packages you have published.

Your package should appear on the list, **pat yourself on the back!**
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Click the name of your package on the list and view it on npm. Notice a few things.

The npm page for a package shows the **text from the README.md** file in the GitHub repo for the package. Your readme should look good and document what your library. This will encourage other developers to use your library.

The version number, last update date, weekly downloads, GitHub repo and more are shown here.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Connect your GitHub to npm

Connecting your npm package to the GitHub source code is a good idea.

https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-package-registry
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Version numbers and SemVer

All packages on npm are using semver. What's semver? Semver stands for semantic version. It's those version numbers you see on everything software:

`1.0.0` or `1.0.16` or `2.1.18`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<div style="font-size:2em">
  <strong>16</strong>.10.2
</div>

The first digit is the **MAJOR** version. You'll update this when you make changes that make a new version **incompatible** with an older version.

<div style="font-size: 2em; text-align: center"><strong>MAJOR</strong>.MINOR.PATCH</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<div style="font-size:2em">
  16.<strong>10</strong>.2
</div>


The second digit is the **MINOR** version. You'll change this when you add **more functionality** but are **still backward compatible**.

<div style="font-size: 2em; text-align: center">MAJOR.<strong>MINOR</strong>.PATCH</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<div style="font-size:2em">
  16.10.<strong>2</strong>
</div>

The last digit is a **PATCH** version. You'll change this when you make **bug fixes and improvements** that are backward compatible but do not add new features.

<div style="font-size: 2em; text-align: center">MAJOR.MINOR.<strong>PATCH</strong></div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
<div style="font-size:2em">
  16.10.2
</div>

<div style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</div>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Version activities

Read the questions below and figure out the new version numbers

- You just **edited** the readme on version 3.1.0
- You just fixed a problem with the `twizzle()` function, a public API, it now **requires** a number: twizzle(times), previous version: 12.11.10
- You just updated `twizzle(times)` again but added a default parameter: `twizzle(times = 1)`

https://semver.org
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Updating your package

When you make changes to your library run:

`npm publish`

Do it now.

You'll probably see an error:

```
npm ERR! 403 Forbidden - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@soggybag%2fjustincase - You cannot publish over the previously published versions: 1.0.2.
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Here I tried to publish but the currently published version is: 1.0.2 and the version I'm publishing is: 1.0.2. These are the same.

**To publish a new version you need to update the version number in package.json.**
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Make a patch, update, and publish

Try that for yourself. Edit the README.md to improve the description.

Call it a PATCH. 

<small>This change is just an improvement, you didn't change any of the method names or parameters, so the API has stayed the same. You also didn't add any new features.</small>

In `package.json` add 1 to the last digit in the version.

If the version was: 1.0.0 change this to 1.0.1
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Now run:**

`npm publish`

Check your package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com ).

Look for the changes to the read and check the version number.

<Small>
Making changes only to the GitHub repo will not show on npm. You'll need to publish a new version.
</small>
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing your lib on npm with RunKit

Visit your library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com ). Find the "Test with RunKit" button.

Clicking this opens RunKit. You'll see a code editor on the left and the ReadMe documenting your library on the right.

Good thing you wrote that documentation!

Write some code and test your package.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Give yourself a badge!

Great work, you deserve a badge!

You've probably seen those nifty badges on display on GitHub repos. Take a look at:

https://github.com/badges/shields

![IXVf2.png](images/IXVf2.png)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The badges make your repos look legit. That's short for *legitimate*, which means:  

> conforming to recognized principles or accepted rules and standards

Code libraries that conform to rules and standards are more likely to get adopters!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
These badges show all sorts of information about the repo, the code in the repo and more. Your repo is just getting started so you can't make use of all of these yet.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Let's start with a couple of easy badges. Size and version.

Go to:

https://shields.io

Click: Size

Click the link to the right of npm bundle size. It looks like:

`/bundlephobia/:format/:packageName.svg`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Now select the format: min, and type your package name into the field. If you have scoped your package include your @username like this: `@username/packagename`.

Choose "Copy Markdown" from the menu at the bottom.

Paste this into your README.md.

Commit and push this to GitHub.

Check out your GitHub page and you should see your new badge!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Repeat this again for the version. Try this on your own. 

Get the npm version number.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Update your npm package page

After you're happy with your GitHub README, update your work on npm.

Update the version number of your package. Is this a MAJOR? MINOR? or PATCH?

`npm publish`

Visit npm and check out your package.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Extend String with prototype

The functions you wrote might take a String as a parameter and return a String. There is nothing wrong with this but there are other approaches.

An alternative might be to add your methods to the String class through the prototype chain. This is how the built-in String functions work!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Q: What is prototype?

A: In JavaScript prototype is a special property all objects have. Objects inherit methods through the prototype. When you call a method on an object, if the method doesn't exist on that object then JavaScript looks for the method on the prototype. By adding a method to an object's prototype all other objects that share the prototype are able to also use the method.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
For example, all Strings share the same prototype. When you call: `"hello".toUpperCase()` calls `toUpperCase()` on the prototype. 'toUpperCase' is really long, so I'd rather write 'allCaps' to do the same thing.

```
// Assign a new method to String.prototype
String.prototype.allCaps = function() {
  return this.toUpperCase()
}

const str = 'hello world'
console.log(str.allCaps()) // HELLO WORLD
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Important!**

Inside the allCaps function `this` is the string/object that you called the method on. In this case, it's `str` on the last line above.

You cannot use an arrow function here! *Arrow functions do not bind this* so this is lost! It's not the object that called the method.

Using ES5 functions the value for this is the object the method was called on.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Challenge

Rewrite your string functions so they are all methods of the String object. This means you'll need to add them all to `String.prototype`. Here is a sample:

```
// Capitalize first letter
String.prototype.capitalize = function() {
  return this.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + this.slice(1)
}
```
