Quality code is test passing code. Unit testing is a system that is used to test units of code. Code that passes the test is deemed quality and fit for use. Unit testing is a part of the Agile Methodology.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Why use unit tests?

Improves code quality by exposing edge cases and finding bugs.

Spots bugs earlier. Using tests will bring bugs to light before you publish your app.

Reduces defects when integrating new features.

Professionals use unit tests. If you are planning to get a with a company that employs more than a single developer, you will probably be writing unit tests at some point, so you should learn how to do it.

## Unit Testing
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** What is a unit test?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A:** A unit test is a test of a software system, usually a single function. A unit test most often is testing that the expected output of a function is correct for a given input.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** How do you do a unit test?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A:** Unit tests are run by software and can be automated. In this class, we will use Jest.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** What is Jest?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A:** [Jest](https://jestjs.io) is a JavaScript testing framework that was written by Facebook. It works with:

- TypeScript
- Node
- React
- Vue
- Angular
- and more
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** Why use Jest?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A:** Jest works well with React. If you're building React apps Jest is a good choice. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** What can you test?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A:** Usually you are testing functions by looking at the output for a given input.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Q:** How do you write a test?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**A:** Before writing a test you'll want to think about what you are testing and what you should test for.

For example, you wrote a function that uppercased the first letter of a string. You might expect the input to be:

widget -> Widget

Can you think of any edge cases?

What about the capitalizeAll() function what would be a good test? What are the edge cases?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing example

Heard of Fizz Buzz? Everyone is writing this program but no one is writing tests! There are so many faulty FizzBuzz applications in the world we could have a major problem on our hands!

Pair with someone **you haven't paired with before**.

The goal of this exercise is to write some tests with Jest that test the functions in the [Fizz Buzz sample code](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/fizz-buzz-test).
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Getting Started Fizz Buzz

- Make a new directory
- Navigate the terminal to the directory
- `npm init -y`
- `touch index.js` 
- Get the [Fizz Buzz sample code](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/fizz-buzz-test)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Writing tests with Jest

Jest is a framework that you will use as a *dev dependency*. A dev dependency is one that is used for development but _not used in your source code_.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Add Jest:

`npm install --save-dev jest`

`--save-dev` creates an entry under `"devDependencies"` in your `package.json`. Look for this right now.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Now that jest is installed, you need a test command. Add this to `package.json`. Add/edit `package.json` to look like this:

```JSON
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
},
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You'll run a test with:

`npm run test`

Try it now. You should see an error:

```
...
No tests found, exiting with code 1
...
```

You haven't written any tests yet so this makes sense.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Add a new directory named "tests".

`mkdir tests`

Now add a new file `tests/test.js`. Your tests will be written here.  

`touch tests/test.js`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
When you run Jest it will look for any files with `test.js` in the name and run any test code found there. Jest logs the results of all tests to the console.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
A test is run by calling:

`test(desc, callback)`

You supply two parameters a *description string* and a *callback function*.

Open `test.js` in your editor and write a test. Add the following  code to `test.js`:

```JavaScript
test('Sanity check', () => {

})
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Run your test.

`npm run test`

You should see some output in the console.

```
...
 PASS  tests/test.js
  ✓ Sanity check (1ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
...
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Looks like 1 test  passed out of a total of 1 test.

What did we test? Nothing. The callback function will register an error if any code executed inside it *throws an error*, otherwise the test is passing.

Add the following inside the callback.

```
test('Sanity check', () => {
  expect(2+2).toBe(5)
})
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Run your test again. The test should *fail* this time.

```
...
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       1 failed, 1 total
...
```

`expect().toBe()` is an assertion. An assertion is you expressing the answer you are expecting to get. *Here you are saying you expect `2+2` to be `5`*. Expecting `2+2` to `5` is insane so the assertion fails.

Fix the test by changing `5` to `4` and run it again. This time the test passes since no error was thrown.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing Fizz Buzz

Your goal is to examine the source code and write some tests. The [Fizz Buzz sample code](https://github.com/Make-School-Labs/fizz-buzz-test) contains these functions. Each function takes some input and returns output. 

- `isFizzy()`
- `isBuzzy()`
- `fizzyBuzzy()`
- `fizzBuzz()`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
For example, the `isFizzy()` function takes a number and returns true if that number is divisible by 3. The test for this might look like:

```JavaScript
test('Test isFizzy', () => {
  expect(tests.isFizzy(1)).toBe(false)
  expect(tests.isFizzy(3)).toBe(true)
  expect(tests.isFizzy(4)).toBe(false)
  expect(tests.isFizzy(6)).toBe(true)
})
```
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Testing basics 

**[`expect()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect)**

Use `expect()` to look at a value. Call one of these methods to check that value: 

- [`.toBe(value)`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#tobevalue) to compare primitive values
- [`.toEqual(value)`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#toequalvalue) to check equality of objects. This does a recursive "deep" check for equality. 
- [`.not`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#not) to check something is not the value you were expecting. 

See the link to the docs above for more information. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Activity

Write tests for FizzBuzz. Do your best write as many tests as you can. 

**Before writing any code.** Discuss with a partner what you are going to test. Describe the test you are going to write. Your partner should think of any edge cases or problems areas. Then switch roles.  

Refer to the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html) while you work. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Checking Coverage

How much of your code is covered by the test you wrote? Pretty good question huh?

Jest will automate this for you. 

`npx jest --coverage`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
This should provide output similar to: 

```
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
File      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines | Uncovered Line #s |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
All files |    96.88 |      100 |       80 |    96.55 |                   |
 index.js |    96.88 |      100 |       80 |    96.55 |                70 |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-------------------|
```

This tells you what % of code statements were covered by the tests. What % of code branches were covered, these are if else, switch cases etc. What % of functions were tested. What % of lines of code were tested, and line numbers for lines of code that were not tested. 

Check coverage and identify what has not been tested. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Debriefing the tests

Discuss these questions

- What did you test?
- What was easy to test?
- What was difficult to test?
- How many things did a test have to look at?
- Are you confident that your tests will catch errors that might arise with any possible input?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Testing the string functions

To use your library in your tests you'll need to import it. Tests are run in the Node environment use `require()` to import them as a module.

`const lib = require('../index.js')`

Modify the line above to suit your situation. The name of the var can be anything. The path and name to point to your string lib relative to `test.js`.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Note! If your functions are global or they are added to the prototype of a global object you can just use something like:

`require('../index.js')`

Use the coverage command with Jest to test the coverage of your tests.
