## JavaScript Libraries
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Why make JavaScript libraries? 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
- You'been using npm time to get a closer look
- Practice your programming skills
- Industry best practices 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Q: What is npm?

npm is the world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**NPM has three parts:**

- the website
- the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- the registry
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Use **npm** to host and distribute your software frameworks and libraries as “packages”. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: What are libraries?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**What are Libraries?**

- A library is a collection of code. 
- Written to be used in any application. 
- Libraries are best when they do one thing. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**Why write a library?**

- You don’t want to write the same thing again.
- Sharing code helps the community build applications faster.
- DRY!
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
**When to write a library?**

- Code that has a _very specific use case_ - **probably not**
- Code that _has general uses_ - **probably!**
- “I wish this was built in…” - **write a library**
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: Why make a library?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
By putting the code in a library you are making it **portable** and packaging it in a form that is **easily shared**.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You're also **taking DRY to the next level!** 

The code in a library can be **shared across multiple projects**, and  changes, and bug fixes can all be made in a single location.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: When to make a library?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Any time you find you are writing the same code in more than one project. 

When you have code that you want to share with other people.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: What will I make in this class?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
You will write several libraries. The libraries you write will be smaller and focus on utility functions at first. 

Think of the code in each of the libraries written in this class as an interview question.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Much of the code we write here has already been written. Normally we wouldn't want to reinvent the wheel, but the goal of this class is learning how to write code and how to turn it into libraries. From that perspective, recreating code that already exists is a great learning experience.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: What kinds of libraries are people making in 2019?

Here is a list of libraries that you may have used before. Pair up and take a look at the list at the link below and discuss what's there.

https://tutorialzine.com/2019/04/10-interesting-javascript-and-css-libraries-for-april-2019

**Discussion:** What did you find on that list?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: What kinds of libraries have you used in past projects?

**Discuss** with your pair...
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: What about utility libraries?

Pair and look at the link below. It's a list of utility libraries.

https://blog.bitsrc.io/11-javascript-utility-libraries-you-should-know-in-2018-3646fb31ade

**Discussion:** What do you see there? What are these libraries good for?
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Q: What kind of code do you see?

Take a look at a couple of libraries below and look at the code. With your pair discuss the general features of the code.

Just skim the repos and look at a couple of files. Usually, the code will be in `index.js` or in `src` folder.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Answer these questions as you explore the repos below.

- How much code is there?
- How is it organized?
- What language?

## Writing your first library

The goal of the first homework assignment is to write a simple library.

Why write a simple library? If we keep it simple you will be able to do a good job and get it finished before the next class.

Why write a library at all? Remember all of the advantages of storing code in a central location. While it might not seem to add too much to your workflow today, this is how professionals handle code.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### String functions

Strings are one of, if not the most common data type you might work with. JavaScript provides many string functions such as:

- [`String.toUpperCase()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
- [`String.charAt()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt)
- [`String.endsWith()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/endsWith)
- [And many more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
The problems outlined in the homework can be solved in many different ways. Here are a few ideas to get you started.

- String.charAt()
- String.toUpperCase()
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Use these to make the first letter of a string uppercase.

Arrays can help you solve other problems. Try making the first letter of each word in a String uppercase. Assume that each word is separated by a " ". Use these functions:

- String.split()
- String.toUpperCase()
- Array.join()
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
Add your new methods to the prototype. 

This makes the methods available to all instances of that class.

```js
String.prototype.capitalize = function() {
   return this.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + this.slice(1)
}

“Hello world”.capitalize() -> “Hello world”
```
