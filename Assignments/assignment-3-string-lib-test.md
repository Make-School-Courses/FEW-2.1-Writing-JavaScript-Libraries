# FEW 2.1 - Assignment 3 - String Lib Tests

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to write unit tests for your String Lib. 

### Why this assignment?

Testing is part of the Agile development process. Expect to see at companies large and small. Using tests improves code quality. 

## Project requirements

You need to write tests that guarantee that your functions are working correctly. You should identify any edge cases and your tests should test for these. 

You need at least one test for each of your functions.

- capitalize()
- allCaps()
- capitalizeWords()
- oddCaps()
- evenCaps()
- removeExtraSpaces()
- kabobCase()
- snakeCase()
- camelCase()

If you've added any extra functions you should write tests for those also. 

For more complex functions you might include more than one test case. Your job is to think of what can go wrong and write a test to catch those situations. 

### Deliverable

`test.js` file in your GitHub Repo with all of the written test cases. 

I should be able to run the test suite in your repo and see the results in the console. 

### Due date

Class 4
