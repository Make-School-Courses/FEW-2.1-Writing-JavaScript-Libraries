Challenges 

- Number Methods - This method already exists, your job is to make a method that does the same thing. Rather than Math.round(x) your method will work like this: x.round(). 
  - round() - x = 9.99 - x.round() -> 10
  - floor() - x = 9.99 - x.floor() -> 9
  - ceil() - x = 1.03 - x.ceil() -> 2
- pad(x, y) - pads Number with x 0 before, and y 0 after. 
  - Example: 34.801.pad(4,4) -> 0034.801
- degToRad() - 
- radToDeg() - 
- toDollars() - 
  - 3.99 -> $3.99
  - 0.99 -> Â¢0.99
  - pads with 0 1.99 -> $01.99
